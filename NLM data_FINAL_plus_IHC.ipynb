    "_**Introduction**_\n",
    "\n",
    "The National Library of Medicine (NLM) produces a resource named HealthReach (http://healthreach.nlm.nih.gov) that provides access to free low literacy, mulitlingual health information to be used by healthcare providers with patients/clients. NLM collects the materials and indexes with controlled vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can access the HealthReach collection through the website but our interest is to make our collection only available through an application programming interface (API). We curently have a closed API that we share with another NLM resource, and a hospital in Kenya that is pulling English, French, and Swahili materials into their patient electronic health records (EHR). The HealthReach program manager wants everyone to be able to pull the exact materials they want (determined by metadata) and use as they need it, when they need it, and where they need it. \n",
    "\n",
    "_**Statement of Need**_\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of our users are in the healthcare service field and do not feel they are \"savvy\" in technology. Therefore dicussions of APIs and data often stall conversations about how they can customize the use of the HealthReach data. This is unfortunate as the true strength of the collection would be at point of need in the EHR...not stored in a web database that must be accessed, searched, and retrieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make our current users more comfortable with thinking about the multilingual collection of HealthReach as \"data,\" we created a visualization of the collection in Tableau https://healthreach.nlm.nih.gov/data-viz. To create the visualizations in Tableau the progammer and program manager have to put in siginificant effort into accurately determining, combining, and displaying the data. The data is extracted directly from the database and users are provided .csv files of the data under an \"accessibility\" section. The program manager is responsible for checking the Tableau displays to ensure the \"numbers\" are correct. This is not inconsequential - not only does the program manager not want to do this, but the data that is displayed cannot easily be checked from the .csv because some \"massaging\" of the data has been done, and the data changes over time. For all of its transparency faults and diffculty in creating, Tableau provides an interactive and approachable interface for low-data literacy consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To best serve the ~~lazy~~ program manager, we will use Python to automate a task she doesn't want to do - check the \"numbers\" in the visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "_**Demonstration**_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this presentation we will replicate one visualization on the HealthReach Tableau.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we pulled data from the HealthReach database and exported to an common-seperated value (.CSV) spreadsheet. We will use this data taken on Novermeber 28, 2018 for our visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/BIOF309/final-project-nlm/blob/master/HealthReach_Data_11_28_2018.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "We can view our the .CSV file, but that is a alot of data for a non-programmer to view. We have over 8,000 rows and 21 columns. We will use **Python for data anyalsis** or **pandas** for short. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin by importing **pandas** so we can use it for our visualizations."

    "**Reminder:** The numbers and language order in the bar graph here are **not** the same as the HealthReach data since the raw data differs for each. HealthReach data uses Titles and the Occurrence here is the occurrence of each language after being parsed into individual rows. Duplicate titles for languages exist in the raw data for this bar graph, so numbers here are likely to be higher than on the HealthReach website."
